            <p class="aims"> <br>The aim of this project is to examine the relationship between modern corruption and economic development. Whilst the nature of 
            corruption makes it very difficult to analyse, the project will look at 
            how countries with different levels of corruption are growing and spending. Furthermore there will be a brief analysis looking at 
            channels of preventing/ reducing corruption.

            Since the study reflects the current day, the most recent data available will be used where applicable. <br>

                Before continuing with the consequences of corruption, VegaLite was used to add a regression 
                and R squared value to show a positive correlation between corruption and log GDP Per Capita 
                <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1aFUGtD0_CthyWFE3QkwPC9qUThhNqO3O"

                also been used but it was found to be easier to embed it in the visualisation itself.

           This visualisation adds a third dimension, economic inequality. The sizes and colours of the bubbles 
            indicates that countries with higher levels of corruption tend to have a higher degree of economic 
            inequality. However, there are still some countries with low perceived corruption and high inequality.

            Herein, the economic consequences of corruption in ten European countries are examined.
            Five of which are perceived as corrupt, and five clean. The countries are listed in order 
            of corruption perception.

            To look at the consequences of corruption, expenditure on healthcare and 
            education were selected as well as domestic and foreign investment as percentages of
            GDP. Figure 5 shows what was expected: corrupt countries spend less on healthcare and
            education. It is also expected that corrupt countries have a lot less domestic and foreign 
            investment. However, Figure 6 shows that there was no clear difference, a surprising result.
            Data from the World Bank was used, which was cleaned extensively and merged with other datasets.
            For Domestic Investment a <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zWSGi2cXHEYuj7ZL2z4sfycLPPgA8Ttn" 
             target="_blank">scraper</a> was used to take data from The Global Economy.

        <p>For the last visualisation, transparency in fighting corruption was reviewed using the voice 
            and accountability indicator. It is clear that more politically transparent countries are a lot 
            less corrupt.

            Initially, a problem was combining datasets which had different names for
             the same Country, this was overcome with either Stata or Python. I preferred 
             Stata because of the _merge variable. I used Python whenever I had a formatting problem
              as pandas made it easy to change datasets into long format using ‘melt’. This could 
              also have been done within VegaLite using ‘fold’ in ‘transform’. Another problem was the World
               Bank API. I began the project using the API as I wanted to include more automation, 
               but unfortunately I found the API was limited, as it was incapable of containing all 
               the data I needed. The API only contained countries up to the letter ‘C’ and no further. 
               I could have used loops, but this method would lose its efficiency. 
               Ultimately I decided to use CSVs as there were no other relevant APIs. I also 
               found that CPI was the most well rounded corruption index, but due to its sourcing it was not 
               suitable for time series or comparison, so while I initially wanted to show
                how corruption had evolved, I felt it would have been misleading and decided to use the latest
                 data. Lastly, I used a trick to scrape the data for domestic investment after receiving 
                 errors the usual way.

        <h1 class="Week">Conclusions:</h1>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <p>
                There is a positive correlation between Log GDP Per Capita and how clean a country is. 
                With this established it is fair to analyse what corruption does to slow economic development.
                Spending did appear to be diverted away from healthcare and education in countries with higher
                levels of corruption. The effect on domestic and foreign investment was unclear, which was not
                expected. It also seems that political transparency is an effective way to combat corruption.
                It is important to note that the nature of corruption makes interpreting the data dubious. 
                Furthermore, results should not be mistaken for causal relationships, it is unclear whether 
                corruption is causing slow development or vice versa. There is a need for further study and data
                collection as in the age of information, corruption is harder to detect than ever and there is a
                lack of data. For example, more channels of combating corruption such as relative public sector 
                wages and hiring processes could have been included, but it was difficult to find any data.
